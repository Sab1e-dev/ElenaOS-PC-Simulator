# ElenixOS Simulator

This repository is the dedicated simulator project for ElenixOS on desktop platforms.
It is pre-configured for VSCode and supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
FreeRTOS is also included and can be optionally enabled to better simulate embedded system behavior.

```

## Documentation

The usage guide has been moved to the ElenixOS documentation site.

Please read:

## Optional library

There are also FreeType and FFmpeg support. You can install these according to the followings:

### Linux

```bash
# FreeType support
wget https://kumisystems.dl.sourceforge.net/project/freetype/freetype2/2.13.2/freetype-2.13.2.tar.xz
tar -xf freetype-2.13.2.tar.xz
cd freetype-2.13.2
make
make install
```

```bash
# FFmpeg support
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg
git checkout release/6.0
./configure --disable-all --disable-autodetect --disable-podpages --disable-asm --enable-avcodec --enable-avformat --enable-decoders --enable-encoders --enable-demuxers --enable-parsers --enable-protocol='file' --enable-swscale --enable-zlib
make
sudo make install
```
### (RT)OS support
Works with any OS like pthred, Windows, FreeRTOS, etc. It has build in support for FreeRTOS.

## Test
This project is configured for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and is tested on:
- Ubuntu Linux
- Windows WSL (Ubuntu Linux)

It requires a working version of GCC, GDB and make in your path.

To allow debugging inside VSCode you will also require a GDB [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug) or other suitable debugger. All the requirements, build and debug settings have been pre-configured in the [.workspace](simulator.code-workspace) file.

The project can use **SDL** but it can be easily relaced by any other built-in LVGL dirvers.
